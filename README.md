# Cloudflare's challange-1 implementation

## The challange
> :fire: You are a developer for a national concert promoter. :fire:
> Music fans from all over the world visit your site to see when and where the next show is going to be. 
> To save them time when they visit the page, we want to show them upcoming events at a venue close to their location.
> Your task is to create and deploy a Cloudflare Worker that will examine the request for location data, and render HTML featuring information for the closest concert taking place based on the nearest regional Cloudflare Location. Choose locations for testing where you have friends (or a VPN :sweat_smile:) so you can prove this functionality works as expected.
